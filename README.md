New and improved JS Space Racer

This is an update of my original game.

I've included a Google font - Orbitron, it even sounds Space Race like!

i removed the track length option. It was annoying, and mucking up the pre-load of the game screen. Default length, nice.

I've swapped out one of the ships for the same image, but with a transparent background.

Most significantly, I've included some ambient music. I composed it in Garageband and shared it as an mp3.
Added an audio script I found on stackoverflow and BOOM!

But after a couple of rounds I found it more and more annoying, so I added the option to control the audio.

And I added a tweet button too.

All good.  Not too earth shattering changes, but it is interesting how music can really impact the game feel though.

Enjoy.
